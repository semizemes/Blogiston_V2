# Blogiston - JavaScript Learning Project

A hands-on project built while following the Scrimba Essential JavaScript course. This repository demonstrates progressive learning through daily practice and experimentation with core JavaScript concepts.

## 📚 Current Learning Focus

### JavaScript Concepts
- **`.forEach()`** — Array iteration with callback functions
- **UUID Generation** — Creating unique identifiers for data objects

### Web Development Tools
- **CDNs** — Loading external libraries efficiently
- **Icon Integration** — Enhancing UI with icon libraries

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Practical Application** — Apply course concepts in a real development environment
2. **Daily Progress** — Build features incrementally with consistent practice
3. **Modern JavaScript** — Use contemporary syntax and best practices
4. **Clean Architecture** — Maintain organized, readable code structure

## 📝 About This Repository

This project serves as a learning journal and portfolio piece, tracking my journey through JavaScript fundamentals. Each commit represents new concepts learned and implemented, creating a comprehensive record of skill development.

## 🚀 Future Development

As the course progresses, this project will expand to include:
- Advanced JavaScript patterns
- DOM manipulation techniques
- Event handling and user interactions
- Local storage and data persistence
- Enhanced UI/UX features
